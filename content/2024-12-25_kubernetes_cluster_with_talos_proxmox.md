The whole story started for me when a colleague recommended [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/) for building
a Kubernetes cluster on bare metal some weeks ago.
He sent me a video from [DHCP 2024 conference](https://dhcp.cfhn.it/) which dragged me into that topic
(sorry for the German). I was amazed by that concept and immediately started to inhale the docs and related projects
on GitHub.

[Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/) is a special Linux distribution geared towards its only purpose which is
providing a platform for Kubernetes. It comes with an API which can be utilized for provision and configure the OS
installation and the Kubernetes cluster. That makes it an ideal partner for provisioning Tools like
[OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) or Terraform. Consequently, there is no direct shell access to the Talos
machines. The company behind [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/) is [Siderolabs](https://www.siderolabs.com/).

There is this official [terraform-provider-talos](https://github.com/siderolabs/terraform-provider-talos) from
[Siderolabs](https://www.siderolabs.com/) that you can use.

I like that infrastructure-as-code approach, so I started a proof of concept project with
[OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) the next weekend. I already have Proxmox VE as hypervisor running in my home lab,
so I spun up some virtual machines on that server using the [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/) iso image and used the
[Talos Terraform provider](https://github.com/siderolabs/terraform-provider-talos) to provision the Kubernetes cluster.

I was absolutely amazed how easy that was. I just spent roughly three hours to put together this little POC
project: [https://github.com/max-pfeiffer/proxmox-talos-opentofu](https://github.com/max-pfeiffer/proxmox-talos-opentofu)

I encourage everyone to give Talos Linux a shot and try it out.
